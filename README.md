# Data Enginerring Zoom Camp 2024 ðŸš€
Welcome to my Data Engineering journey! This repository documents my daily progress as I delve into the world of Data Engineering through the Zoomcamp 2024 course. The journey began on January 15th, 2024, and I am determined to dedicate 2 hours daily to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the course content

## Overview

### Background ðŸ“–
Initiating the course in 2023, challenges accessing Google Cloud Computing services hindered my progress. However, 2024 presents a new opportunity, and I am determined to overcome obstacles and complete the program. This repository serves as a daily log of my learning, encompassing tools, concepts, and hands-on exercises.

## Daily Log ðŸ“†

### Day 1: 16th January 2024

- **Progress:**
  - Started the course afresh, building on previous knowledge.
  - Explored various terms and tools related to Data Engineering.

### Day 2: 17th January 2024
- **Progress:**
- mapping a volume to the postgress image to an outside folder, so that everyting we run our postgress that data will be stoer eon the local computer
  - Started a postgres docker container, use pgcli to access my database in the command line.
  - ingest data to the database using python, while connecting to the database that was running in docker.

### Day 3: 18th January 2024
- **Progress:**
  - Networking in docker, well we did netoweking via the command line, by noccting the two docker image (pgadmin4 and postres 14) to the same network
  - ingest data to the database using dockerfile.
  - creating docker compose file and running it, the docker compose file is created uisng postgrs and pgadmin image, instead of using command line to run saveral line by flagging our ingested script , we decided to use docker compose to create and connect the tow together, so that when we use Dockerfile to ingest our data to postgres, we will be able to use docker compose to aceess the data.

### Day 4: 19th January 2024
- **Progress:**
- Run through the sql refresher course, by running some sql queriers inpgadmin to query some data
- Setting up google cloud video will be watched but i wont set it up untill,  strated using it
- Learn about Terraform

### Day 4: 19th January 2024
- **Progress:**
- Run through the sql refresher course, by running some sql queriers inpgadmin to query some data
- Setting up google cloud video will be watched but i wont set it up untill,  strated using it
- Learn about Terraform

### Day 4: 20th January 2024
- **Progress:**
- watched the terraform video, learn ablot on terrafrom, create a gcs bucket and destroy it
- 


This journey promises to be exciting as I navigate through different tools and concepts in Data Engineering. Cheers to continuous learning and growth! ðŸŒ±
